# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch in Python (No Libraries)

This project is a **fully functional neural network** built entirely from scratch in Python — **no external libraries like TensorFlow, or PyTorch used**. It's designed to give a clear, hands-on understanding of how neural networks actually work under the hood.

## 🚀 Features

- Forward propagation
- Custom activation functions (ReLU, Softmax, etc.)
- Train on simple datasets
- Manual weight and bias updates
- Fully written using only Python built-ins (Used numpy in the later files for better readability but still everything is from scratch wherever i used  Numpy i have done that using just raw python in the previous files)

 ## 📚 Future Improvements

 - Backword propogation
 - Optimization
