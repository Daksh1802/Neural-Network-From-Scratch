# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch in Python (No Libraries)

This project is a **fully functional neural network** built entirely from scratch in Python — **no external libraries like TensorFlow, or PyTorch used**. It's designed to give a clear, hands-on understanding of how neural networks actually work under the hood.
